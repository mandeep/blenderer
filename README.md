========================

This repository contains a host of Python scripts that can be used at the command
line to render images via Blender's command line interface.

Installation
------------

As of Blender 2.91, Blender's python version is Python 3.7. If you're using
Python 3.7, you may be able to install this package with Blender's python
after calling ensurepip. However, this is not guaranteed to work for all
operating systems. For an easier time, you can just copy and paste the

functions as needed.
